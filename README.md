# accessibilityCarousel

A task to create a carousel that is properly accessible by screen readers

## Observations

- Screen reader reads the buttons once clicked or when it is navigated to using keyboard tab
- Changed the play and pause button aria-labels to match a statement that is true after when the button is clicked
- Role of the html element is read out loud. Arrow buttons being announced as navigation elements sounded clearer
- Alt descriptions given to images are read out loud, giving a detailed description of the image made the experience better
